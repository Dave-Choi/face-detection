# Face Detection in JavaScript with getUserMedia

Adapted to work with the getUserMedia API using code from [github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection](https://github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection)

[Try out the demo](http://neave.github.com/face-detection/) using Google Chrome with the "MediaStream" flag enabled in about:flags

Note that this demo only works online (or localhost) due to security restrictions. It won't work on a local file:/// system!


Inspired by this paragraph:
> Can we count on context? Can we assume that everyone holds a phone or tablet at the same distance, or that desktop browsers are all hunched over a desk? I don’t think so, and the width-based approach I described earlier works well for scaling font-size. Until computers sense a user’s reading distance and adjust page scale proportionally (sounds like a nightmare, right?) we’ll have to make these sensible generalizations. I think it’s safe to. It’s the responsive way.
